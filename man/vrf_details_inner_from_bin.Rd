\title{Method for comparing the inner part for the details query with the raw images
as the base arguments. This is a part of a group of image processing functions
that work with different image abstractions (file, image, raw image). These
methods are intended to improve the performance so that best suiting method
version can be used depending on what data is available from the earlier
method calls to the same comparator instance.}
\usage{
vrf_details_inner_from_bin(comparator, image1_raw, image2_raw)
}
\arguments{
\item{comparator}{comparator instance used for the comparison}

\item{image1_raw}{first image as raw binary string to compare}

\item{image2_raw}{second image as raw binary string to compare}
